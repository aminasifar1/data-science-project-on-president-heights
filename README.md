____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In this repository we will work with data to analyse the President Heights around the world using Machine Learning concepts.
The dataset is available in the file president_heights.csv and its values:
* **order:** index from 1 to n.
* **name:** name of each president.
* **height (cm):** height of each president.
  
### Extraction of information
We'll use the Pandas package to read the file, extract and save as an array this information. The only feature we need to use for prediction is **the heights**.

### Summary statistics
